# pidradar

Pidradar is an open-source project developed by a single developer. It's a flutter app displaying all the PID(Prague Integrated Traffic System) vehicles through the use of their api. Currently, you can either see all vehicles on the map, moving simultaniously, or you can search for a specific one using the app searchbox.
Nothing special, but an ok beginner project. The API gives us decent information about all PID vehicles, including their coords atm. with a 20 sec latency per vehicle.(theres not really a way to make it faster)
